# Donate to F-Droid

F-Droid is a really amazing alternative to the Google Play Store, as it only offers apps that are free and open source, and yetCalc is one such app as well.
Thanks to its great community of developers, maintainers, and contributors, we can really explore the large abundance of free and open-source apps.
Please consider donating to F-Droid if you can: [Donate to F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/donate/)
