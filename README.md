<h1 align="center">yetCalc</h1>

The free and open source calculator developed for Android 5.0 and above using Kotlin. yetCalc's calculator mode uses the [mXparser](https://mathparser.org/) library. Large calculations are handled without device freezing and other issues, although some calculations might take time.

    - Support for all basic operators.
    - Progressive calculations.```(results appear on top and change side by side as you change the expression)```
    - Provides commonly used constants.```(Some constants might result to 0 if precision setting is not high)```
    - Switch between different angle measurements with ease.
    - Scientific Mode that provides various trigonometric, hyperbolic and inverse functions, calculus and iterated operators, much more.
    - Provides variable support.```(only 1 variable)```
    - Precision settings for precise calculations.
    - Operations like copy, cut, paste, delete are handled and results are changed accordingly.
    - Vibrations when clicking buttons?(don't know if I should have mentioned it here)

    **DO NOTE**: Inorder to use scientific features, the device should be in landscape mode.
